# Palomar Submission

Mechanical verification for the Palomar registry.

[**Submit a Lean-verified result →**](https://submit.palomar-registry.org)

The form asks for a public GitHub repository, an immutable commit, the
repository-relative path of exactly one Comparator configuration, and a
declaration of the submitter's relationship to the substantive formalization,
which is a claim about a person rather than about the code and is recorded
permanently. The repository itself carries the metadata. One configuration
becomes one Palomar entry; several configurations at the same repository and
commit are submitted separately, while one configuration selecting several
declarations is verified and reviewed as a whole. CI then:

1. validates the required root files and pinned commit, including parsing
   `formalization.yaml` and enforcing Palomar's documented metadata minimum;
2. installs a matching `lean4export`;
3. runs [Comparator](https://github.com/leanprover/comparator) under its Landrun
   sandbox, permitting at most the three standard axioms, and forces every
   exported proof through both Lean's kernel and the pinned independent NanoDa
   kernel;
4. compiles the Challenge against frozen, canonical Mathlib/Tau Ceti output;
5. computes the transitive source closure of the Challenge and verifies every
   byte in it;
6. publishes a machine-readable report as a run artifact.

Verification is dispatched by the submission server, not started from this
repository. The run carries the submission identifier in its name, and the
report leaves as an artifact rather than as a comment, so nothing here needs a
credential that can write anywhere.

The proof project may use arbitrary pinned **public GitHub** Git dependencies
at full 40-character commit SHAs. They build from source inside Palomar's fresh
Lake build directories. Submitted or substantive source repositories containing
Git submodules are rejected. An inert submodule gitlink in a dependency is
allowed because dependency submodules are never initialized or read; the exact
gitlink is retained by the archive fork. Git LFS pointers are rejected everywhere, as are
Git dependencies hosted anywhere other than GitHub. Palomar must be able to
preserve the complete source graph consumed by the accepted build in ordinary
Git. The Challenge is compiled
separately without candidate Lake configuration, against only verified
allowlisted dependencies; its protected module is the statement Comparator
exports. Common submitted prebuilt artifacts are rejected early, and no
candidate build output can replace the protected statement or frozen trusted
dependency modules. Only this statement surface is restricted; arbitrary pinned
dependencies remain available to the proof in `Solution.lean`. A Tau Ceti import
is recorded as a qualified trust surface; no other statement dependency is
accepted, including one from a project Palomar has already indexed.

NanoDa replay is a registry invariant, not a submitter option. A submitted
`comparator.json` must contain `"enable_nanoda": true` with the JSON boolean value
exactly; false, missing, non-boolean, and unknown compatibility fields fail
intake. The trusted runner copies the validated configuration byte-for-byte to
a protected path and passes that unchanged copy to Comparator.

AI review is not part of this repository's CI.
[`PalomarReviewer`](https://github.com/PalomarRegistry/PalomarReviewer) runs it
automatically against the mechanical report of a passing run, using the prompts
in [`PalomarPolicy`](https://github.com/PalomarRegistry/PalomarPolicy). No
person starts a review or approves its result.

## Required source layout

See [`PalomarRegistry/PalomarPolicy`](https://github.com/PalomarRegistry/PalomarPolicy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The contract is:

```text
lean-toolchain            # in the project or the repository root
lakefile.toml             #   or lakefile.lean, which also needs lake-manifest.json
formalization.yaml
<the Comparator configuration named by the submission>
<its challenge_module and solution_module sources>
LICENSE                   # repository root, and only there
```

Only `formalization.yaml` is required under that exact name. The Challenge and
Solution paths follow from `challenge_module` and `solution_module` in the
Comparator configuration, and the configuration's own path is the one the
submission named, so none of the three is a fixed filename. The selected project
need not be the repository root either: `project_path` may name a subdirectory,
and everything but the licence is resolved inside it.

The licence filename is case-insensitive and may instead use `LICENCE`,
`COPYING`, `UNLICENSE`, or `OFL`, with an optional `.md`, `.markdown`, or
`.txt` extension. Exactly one such regular root file is required. It must be
nonempty UTF-8 text, match one standard SPDX licence mechanically, and agree
exactly with the SPDX identifier in `project.license`.

`formalization.yaml` must be valid YAML with one top-level mapping and nonempty
project identity, authorship, license, classification, automation-method, and
review-status fields. Classification requires one or two official arXiv subject
classes and between one and eight distinct MSC2020 codes. The current provenance
contract also requires a nonempty `project.responsible_maintainers` list, a
`repository.role` of `substantive-development` or `thin-wrapper`, and a nonempty
`sources` list. Every source, including an `original-proof` entry, needs a
`relationship`. An `original-proof` entry must use `relationship: other`;
additional sources accompanying an original result may use `background` or
`other`. A `formalizes`, `adapts`, or `independently-proves` relationship instead
declares the result source-based and therefore conflicts with `type:
original-proof` anywhere in the list. Thus a result is original exactly when at
least one entry is `original-proof`, every such entry uses `other`, and every
other relationship is `background` or `other`; it is source-based exactly when
there is no `original-proof` entry and at least one relationship is
`formalizes`, `adapts`, or `independently-proves`. All other combinations fail.
A supplied source `type` must be exactly `paper`, `book`, `web discussion`,
`folklore`, `original-proof`, or `other`; it may be omitted except where
`original-proof` is the origin declaration. Invalid or missing provenance fails
mechanical verification with the field that needs changing.
Do not add a top-level `provenance` block: put maintainers under `project`, the
repository role under `repository`, and result origin in the source entries as
above. The exact mechanical minimum is enforced here; the fields' intended
meaning and authoring conventions are documented in
[`PalomarPolicy/CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/PalomarRegistry/PalomarPolicy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#3-write-formalizationyaml).

The checked-in identifier lists under [`taxonomies/`](taxonomies/) are snapshots
of the official [arXiv taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy) and
[MSC2020](https://msc2020.org/). Their purpose is exact intake validation; the
editorial AI separately checks whether the selected subjects are plausible for
the submitted result.

The prototype accepts public GitHub repositories and any released or RC Lean
toolchain at or above the minimum recorded in
[`toolchains.json`](toolchains.json). There is no list of accepted versions:
the matching tooling revisions are derived from the toolchain's release tag,
which is what a table of them kept getting wrong. The file is deliberately a
closed record containing only its schema version and the minimum Lean release;
it does not claim to configure tooling repositories that the verifier does not
read from it.

## Licensing

PalomarSubmission's software is MIT-licensed. The vendored taxonomy data is a
separate work under the terms recorded in [`taxonomies/LICENSE.md`](taxonomies/LICENSE.md).
Submission licence validation covers the submitted repository snapshot only;
cited papers, reused formalizations, and dependencies retain their own licences.

## Security

Submission Lean is hostile input. The verification job has read-only repository
permissions and no credential in its environment, and its only output is a
bounded JSON artifact, so there is no second job holding a write token to
compromise. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) before changing the workflow or
verifier.

## Development checks

Repository Python files use the `E`, `F`, `I`, `UP`, and `B` Ruff rule families declared
in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Install the single locked lint dependency
and run the same check as CI with:

```sh
python -m pip install --disable-pip-version-check --require-hashes \
  --no-deps --only-binary=:all: -r requirements-lint.txt
python -m ruff check .
```

The verifier runtime dependency remains separately locked in
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt); Ruff is not installed in verification
or cold-build jobs.
